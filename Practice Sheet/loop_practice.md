coding questions focused on using loops with numbers and strings in Python

### 1. **Reverse Digits of a Number**
**Problem**: Write a program that takes a positive integer and reverses its digits using a loop. If the input is `1234`, the output should be `4321`.

**Input**:
- A positive integer.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 1234
Output: 4321
```

**Hint**: Use a `while` loop to extract each digit and construct the reversed number.

### 2. **Count Vowels in a String**
**Problem**: Develop a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string. It should go through each character in the string and check if it is a vowel.

**Input**:
- A string.

**Example**:
```python
Input: "OpenAI is amazing"
Output: 7
```

**Hint**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through each character and an `if` condition to check for vowels.

---

### 3. **Check Palindrome Number**
**Problem**: Write a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., `121`).

**Input**:
- A positive integer.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 121
Output: True
```

**Hint**: Reverse the digits using a `while` loop and compare the original and reversed numbers.

### 4. **Generate Multiplication Table**
**Problem**: Create a program that generates the multiplication table for a given number up to 10. It should print the table in the format `n x i = result`.

**Input**:
- A positive integer `n`.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 5
Output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50
```

**Hint**: Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and calculate the product.

---

### 5. **Character Frequency Counter**
**Problem**: Write a program to count the frequency of each character in a given string. The program should output the character and its count for each character in the string.

**Input**:
- A string.

**Example**:
```python
Input: "hello"
Output: 
h: 1
e: 1
l: 2
o: 1
```

**Hint**: Use a `for` loop and keep track of the counts using variables for each unique character.

---

### 6. **Sum of Digits**
**Problem**: Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. For example, for the number `123`, the sum of the digits would be `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

**Input**:
- A positive integer.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 456
Output: 15
```

**Hint**: Use a `while` loop to extract each digit and add it to a running total.

---

### 7. **Print a Pattern of Stars**
**Problem**: Write a program that prints a pyramid pattern of stars based on a given number of rows. For example, if the input is `5`, the output should be:

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

**Input**:
- A positive integer `n` representing the number of rows.

**Hint**: Use nested `for` loops to print spaces and stars.

---

### 8. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**
**Problem**: Create a program to convert a binary number (entered as a string) to its decimal equivalent. The binary number should only contain `0`s and `1`s.

**Input**:
- A string representing a binary number.

**Example**:
```python
Input: "1010"
Output: 10
```

**Hint**: Use a `for` loop to iterate over each digit of the binary number, starting from the end.

---

### 9. **Calculate Factorial**
**Problem**: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

**Input**:
- A positive integer `n`.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 5
Output: 120
```

**Hint**: Use a `while` loop to multiply numbers in descending order until 1.

---

### 10. **Print All Prime Numbers Up to n**
**Problem**: Develop a program that prints all prime numbers up to a given number `n`. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Input**:
- A positive integer `n`.

**Example**:
```python
Input: 20
Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
```

**Hint**: Use nested `for` loops to check each number up to `n` for primality.
